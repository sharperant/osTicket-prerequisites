Welcome to my first in-depth IT tutorial! To begin we will have to create a Virtual machine using the Microsoft Azure portal(portal.azure.com). We will be using a VM(virtual machine) which is a remote computer. We are using a VM in order to protect our physical machine just in case something malfunctions, and also have a clean slate computer to continually replicate the lab on. Create a resource group and title it "osTicket". Afterwards create a VM with 2-4 CPUs. In this example I will be using 4 CPUs.
